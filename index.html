                <p> A Machine Learning model developed by processing 200k CelebFace images and using <b>Python </b>that generates images of someone wearing a mask and replace the mask with an accurate representation of their actual face. In this project, according to the Dataset, it predicts and generates the faces of Celebrities who were wearing the mask on their face. The Deep Learning technique of "Generative Adversarial Network" (GAN) model consisting of Generator and Discriminator is used to generate the faces of the Celebrities underneath their mask on face.  </p>
